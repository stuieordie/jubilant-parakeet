# Blink Arm/Disarm Based on Wifi Status

### Goal Of Blink Scripting
- Arm the blink system when I'm not home and disarm when I am
- Arm the blink system at 00:00 regardless of whose home and disarm at 06:00
- Remember to disable cron from daily arms/disarms when on vacation
- Use the pynetgear libraries to check for devices connected to wifi (Samsung S10)
- Download the motion clips for archive
